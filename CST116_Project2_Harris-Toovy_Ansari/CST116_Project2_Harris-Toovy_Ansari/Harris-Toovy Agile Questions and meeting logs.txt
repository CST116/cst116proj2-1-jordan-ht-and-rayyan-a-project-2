NOTICE: THIS DOCUMENT REPRESENTS JORDAN HARRIS-TOOVY'S WORK, AND DOES NOT REPRESENT THE TEAM AS A WHOLE

Disclaimer: Many of the meetings were rushed in-person meetings in between clases, so I was not always able 
to write down theagile question sets - especially since I often was preoccupied providing instruction.

Meeting 10/23/2021 (Online):
1) I will work with Rayyan to setup the Git repo and divide work.
2) I know to basic function of GitHub, and some project managment.
3) I don't know (and am afraid of) how Git-merge works.
---[OUTCOME]---
Due to GitHub realted issues, we were not able to get the project setup, however, we were able to divide the work between us.

Meeting 10/25/2021 (Online):
1) I will work with Rayyan to setup the Git repo.

3) I don't know how the GitHub teams work.
---[OUTCOME]---
We were still unable to fix the GitHub issues, but work began on our local project copies.

Meeting 10/25/2021 (Online):
1) I will work with Rayyan to make the naming convention for our functions.
2) I know a few naming conventions, and I know a bit about parallel devlopment.
3) Since the GitHub classroom repo does not work yet, I don't know the best way to colaborate.

We decided on using the same naming convention as the book. Work continued at normal pace.

2) I know how to avoid most of the GitHub related issues encountered so far, as well as basic testing protocols.

We successfully integrated both codebases, finshed all function calls, tested the program, and began final documentation.
